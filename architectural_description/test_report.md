This test report covers the verification of core functionality in a simplified RPG game system composed of three main components: MiniAbility, MiniPlayer, and MiniEffect. The goal of testing was to ensure that object construction, attribute access, and interactions behave as expected under normal conditions and edge cases.

The MiniAbility class was tested for correct initialization and accurate retrieval of its properties, including name, damage, and mana cost. Test scenarios included typical input values, zero values, empty strings, and negative numbers. All tests passed, confirming that the class handles a wide range of valid and invalid inputs gracefully without unexpected behavior.

The MiniPlayer class underwent more extensive testing. The constructor was verified to initialize attributes correctly, and the ability to add abilities to a player object was confirmed to work as expected. The useAbility function was tested in multiple scenarios: when the player has sufficient mana, when mana is insufficient, when an invalid ability index is used, and when the ability has negative damage (interpreted as healing). In each case, the system responded correctly, including appropriate reductions in mana, rejection of abilities that couldn’t be used, and proper changes in HP. The takeDamage function was also tested to ensure that health points decreased appropriately and never dropped below zero.

For the MiniEffect class, the tests verified that the constructor correctly stored the name and duration of the effect. Cases included both short and long durations to ensure that the class handles varying input sizes. All behavior was consistent with expectations.

Overall, the entire test suite confirms that the game’s core objects behave reliably, manage their internal state correctly, and respond safely to invalid input. The system demonstrates robustness and stability, making it suitable for further development and integration into the larger game logic. All tests passed successfully.
